# Discussion Minutes: Blockchain Land Registry Initiative
**Date:** March 24, 2025
**Duration:** 9:49 AM - 1:00 PM
**Platform:** WhatsApp Group Chat

## Introduction
A discussion was initiated about developing a blockchain-based land registry system as an open-source project to address land-related challenges in The Gambia.

## Key Discussion Points

### Project Overview
- Initiative to create an open-source blockchain land registry system
- Focus on developing local solutions for local problems
- Project repository: https://github.com/alagiesellu/Gambia-Land-Registry-On-Chain

### Technical Considerations
1. **Blockchain vs Traditional Database Debate**
   - Discussion on whether blockchain is necessary vs traditional RDBMS
   - Key advantages of blockchain mentioned:
     - Immutability of records
     - Decentralized nature
     - Prevention of unauthorized alterations
   - Concerns raised about:
     - Implementation complexity
     - Need for proper access control
     - System administration requirements

2. **System Architecture Considerations**
   - Discussion about centralized vs decentralized approaches
   - Considerations for system administration and data entry
   - Need for proper access rights and control mechanisms

### Current Land System Challenges
1. **Documentation Issues**
   - Poor record keeping at local levels
   - Multiple sales of same land
   - Unregistered transactions
   - Slow and centralized documentation process

2. **Infrastructure Challenges**
   - Limited technological access at local levels
   - Traditional paper-based documentation

- Discussion about government's planned Land Management System for 2025
- Need for comprehensive understanding of current land ownership systems
- Importance of stakeholder involvement in system development

## Key Questions Raised
1. How to handle multiple ownership scenarios?
2. Who should be responsible for data entry and system administration?
3. How to address the gap between traditional paper-based systems and digital solutions?
4. What is the role of government vs independent entities in system management?

## Next Steps
1. Schedule follow-up meeting after Eid
2. Review National Land Policy document in detail
3. Document questions and requirements in project issues
4. Engage with stakeholders for comprehensive requirements gathering

## Action Items
- [ ] Organize post-Eid online meeting
- [ ] Review and document land policy requirements
- [ ] Create detailed project requirements document
- [ ] Engage with stakeholders for feedback
- [ ] Document technical architecture considerations

## Additional Notes
- Project aims to be community-driven and open-source
- Focus on creating a system that serves national interests
- Need to consider local challenges and constraints in implementation
- Importance of stakeholder collaboration in development process
