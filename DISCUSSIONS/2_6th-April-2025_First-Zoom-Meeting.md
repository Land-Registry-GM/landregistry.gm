### Pre-Meeting Input
**From Alfusainey Jallow (Unable to attend):**

Common land dispute issues in The Gambia that should inform system requirements:

1. **Double or multiple sales of the same plot**
   - Alkalo or landowner sells the same piece of land to multiple buyers
   - Often due to poor record-keeping or intentional fraud

2. **Lack of proper documentation or unclear ownership**
   - Many land transactions done informally without proper transfer documents
   - Difficult to prove ownership when disputes arise

3. **Inheritance and family disputes over land**
   - Contentious issues when land is passed down through families
   - Problems arise when not all heirs agree on division or sale
   - Unauthorized sales by family members without consent of others

4. **Fraudulent land sales by unauthorized individuals**
   - People posing as rightful owners selling land they don't legally own
   - Buyers may only discover fraud after payment

5. **Encroachment on communal or traditional lands**
   - Land used collectively by communities sometimes sold to private buyers
   - Leads to resistance or disputes from the community
