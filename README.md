# Gambia Land Registry On-Chain  

Welcome to the **Gambia Land Registry On-Chain** project! This is an open-source initiative to explore and collaboratively build a blockchain-based land registry system for **The Gambia** — with aspirations to scale across **Africa** and beyond.  

We are currently in the **early ideation stage**, and your input is crucial.  

### 🚀 **What’s Next?**  
We are now **inviting contributions** to:  
- **Discuss and Propose**: Help shape the goals and objectives of the project.  
- **Identify Priorities**: What are the most important features and values to consider?  
- **Establish Foundations**: Propose and discuss the core principles that will guide the design, development, and implementation of the system.  
- **Define Success**: What does success look like for this project in Gambia and across Africa?  

No decision has been made yet on how the system will function. Every proposal and idea matters. Let’s build this together.  

**This project name is open to change based on community input. Feel free to suggest alternatives!**
